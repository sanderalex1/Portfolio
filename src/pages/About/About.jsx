        <h3>I'm Alex. A designer, maker and problem solver.</h3>
        <p>
          The cusp of art and technology has always fascinated me and I've never
          been afraid to just jump in and give it a go, whether it's Paint,
          Photoshop, Sketch or CSS. I’ve been designing with computers since the
          day I first opened Microsoft Paint. Fast forward to 2023 and I’ve
          tried it all, from Digital Campaign Design and Flash Actionscript to
          Web Design, Animation, HTML/CSS, No-Code Web Development, Product
          Design and Product Management. Everything I have done, small or big,
          has been a vital stepping stone for where I am today. What excites me
          most about being a Product Designer is being able to design and create
          things that have purpose and solve real problems. It goes beyond
          designing buttons and websites and involves having a passion for
          designing experiences and solutions that help people, whether it's
          helping them make better videos, market themselves online, or buy
          something online. Leaning into customer insight and understanding
          their needs, finding the right problems to solve, delivering solutions
          as quickly as possible, learning from those and then iterating and
          improving that value over time is the key to great product design.
          This is one of my favourite quotes (by Peter Drucker):
